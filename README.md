## Technologies/Tools Used

Java 11,
Intellij Idea for Development,
Maven Build Tool ,
JAXB,Swagger Libraries,Springboot with REST API's and 
Lombok Libraries

## Setup & Run Instructions

mvn clean install - it will build application

mvn spring-boot:run - it will run the application

## Swagger Documentation

## Future Code Improvements

Can use JDK 17 and other versions and its features to replace if conditions using Optional.ofNullable().ifPresentOrElse() etc

# Harry-Kart
## Description
Harry-Kart in a special kind of horse racing.

The horses participating have a base speed, they can run with that speed indefinitely.
The track is a 1000 meters loop and is divided in lanes, each horse runs on a lane and every lane has the same length.   
The horses run the first loop at their base speed but at the end of each loop they find a power-up or power-down.

The power-ups/downs are numbers, negative or positive, representing how much the horse speeds up or slows down.

Your task is to compute the top 3 ranking.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
